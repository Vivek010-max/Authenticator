# Frontend Implementation - Certificate Verification System

This frontend implementation provides a complete user interface for the Certificate Verification System with role-based access control and AI-powered document processing.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Admin Role** (`/admin/*`)
- **Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`) - Overview of all system metrics and activity
- **Institute Management** (`/admin/institutes`) - Manage registered institutes and generate credentials
- **Analytics** - View system-wide statistics and performance metrics
- **Verification Management** - Monitor all verification results across the platform

### 2. **Institute Role** (`/institute/*`)
- **Dashboard** (`/institute/dashboard`) - Institute-specific metrics and recent activity
- **Certificate Upload** (`/institute/upload`) - AI-powered single certificate upload and processing
- **Certificates List** (`/institute/certificates`) - View and manage all uploaded certificates
- **Bulk Upload** - Upload multiple certificates at once
- **Analytics** - Institute-specific verification statistics

### 3. **Guest/Verifier Role** (`/upload-verification`)
- **Certificate Verification** - Upload up to 10 certificates for instant verification
- **Real-time Results** - Get immediate verification status (Approved/Fraud/Doubtable)
- **Verification History** - Track recent verification attempts
- **Download Reports** - Export verification results as JSON

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Role-Based Routing
```
/ (Landing) → Role Detection → Redirect to appropriate dashboard
├── /admin/* (Admin only)
├── /institute/* (Institute only)
└── /upload-verification (Public - Guest/Verifier)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on port 5000
- AI API running on port 8001

### Installation
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the Frontend directory:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
VITE_AI_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📊 Data Flow

### Certificate Upload Flow
```
1. User selects files → Frontend validation
2. Files uploaded to Backend → Cloudinary storage
3. Backend sends URL to AI API → OCR processing
4. AI API returns extracted data → Backend
5. Backend returns results → Frontend display
```

### Verification Flow
```
1. Guest uploads certificates → Frontend
2. Files processed by AI → Data extraction
3. Backend compares with database → Verification
4. Results returned → Status display (Approved/Fraud/Doubtable)
```
